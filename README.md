# Parameter

Parameter is a permissionless hedge fund that rewards alpha from anywhere. We believe that collective intelligence in the long-term can outperform a single centralized fund.&#x20;

\
Competition between trading strategies, offers a more adaptive and sustainable approach compared to a fund that operates in a closed environment. **This isn't just about higher returns; it's about maintaining relevance in a market that won't stop changing.** The protocol is designed to continuously source and implement effective strategies, offering a solution that is as agile as the market it operates in.\
\
For strategy builders, the transactions and current holdings are public and auditable, we never have access to the proprietary techniques that are used to decide when to execute, allowing the builders to retain full intellectual property.&#x20;
